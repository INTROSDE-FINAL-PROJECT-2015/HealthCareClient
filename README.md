Is also implemented a score-motivational system, in fact, the application  assigns some goals ( DailyGoals and LongTermGoals ) to the user. At the and of the day the user will insert his/her measurements and if a Long Term Goal is archived the System will provide a Song as prize to the efforts made to archive it and the doctor will be notified with an e-mail, otherwise, if the Goal is not met the system will provide a motivational quotation.
